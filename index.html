            <h2>Empiric laws</h2>
            <div>
                For remote communication applications like Teams and Meets, the empiric laws of Fitts', Hick's, and
                Steering
                can be adapted to the context of multi-device interaction in the following ways:
            </div>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Fitts' Law: This law states that the time required to reach a target is determined by its size and
                    distance from the starting point. In multi-device interaction scenarios, users may have multiple
                    targets on
                    different devices they need to interact with simultaneously. To adapt Fitts' Law in this context,
                    designers
                    should consider not only the size and distance of each target but also their relative importance or
                    priority.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Hick's Law: This law states that increasing the number of choices increases decision time
                    logarithmically. In multi-device interaction scenarios, users may face more choices as they switch
                    between
                    devices or apps. To adapt Hick's Law in this context, designers should aim to minimize unnecessary
                    choices
                    or steps in device switching and provide clear cues for users when making decisions.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Steering Law: This law states that movement towards a target is influenced by its size and proximity
                    to
                    other objects. In multi-device interaction scenarios, users may need to navigate complex interfaces
                    with
                    multiple targets on different devices at once. To adapt Steering Law in this context, designers
                    should
                    consider how visual feedback can help guide user movements across devices while minimizing errors
                    caused by
                    accidental touches or clicks on unintended targets.
