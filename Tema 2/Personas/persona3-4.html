				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Andrei, a 45-year-old mechanic, exemplifies users who may find the least value in the airsoft mobile application. More at home with tangible tools than digital screens, Andrei's interactions with technology are primarily limited to the essential digital tools required in his work, placing him at a beginner's level of tech proficiency.</p>
                <p>Andrei's involvement with airsoft is casual and intermittent. He relishes the adrenaline rush of the game and the team spirit it fosters, but seldom engages with the strategic or logistical aspects of setting up matches. His participation mainly involves showing up at the scheduled games and diving into the play.</p>
                <p>When it comes to the airsoft mobile application, Andrei's usage is minimal. He primarily uses it to stay informed about game details and, occasionally, to check scores. He doesn't harness the app's advanced features such as setting up matches, customizing game settings, or monitoring the maintenance data of his weapon replica.</p>
                <p>Andrei embodies a persona who may not fully exploit the app's capabilities due to his limited tech-savviness and casual interest in airsoft. His primary struggles involve navigating and understanding digital interfaces, often leaving him feeling overwhelmed and less inclined to use the app. Despite his willingness to learn, the technological barriers often stand in his way, limiting the value he extracts from the application.
