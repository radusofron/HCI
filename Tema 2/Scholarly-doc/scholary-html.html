      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="goals">
      <h3><span>4.1. </span>Goals and Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The primary goal of our app is to enable users to organize their games seamlessly and efficiently. We aim to create a platform that is seen as useful and user-friendly, enhancing the overall airsoft gaming experience.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="pain-points">
      <h3><span>4.2. </span>Pain Points</h3>
      <p>
        While our app is designed to be user-friendly, we acknowledge that new users might find certain features a bit complex initially. Especially connecting a new gadget could be perceived as a challenging task.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="emotional">
      <h3><span>4.3. </span>Emotional Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Our user's emotional journey may have highs and lows.

    <section id="paradigms">
      <h2><span>5. </span>Interaction Paradigms</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of our app, interaction paradigms play a crucial role in defining the user experience. These paradigms describe how users engage with the interface and accomplish their tasks, whether it's through direct manipulation of on-screen elements, command-based inputs, or navigation through menus. This chapter explores these interaction paradigms in detail, shedding light on how they contribute to the app's usability and user satisfaction.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="direct">
      <h3><span>5.1. </span>Direct Manipulation</h3>
      <p>
        In our app, users directly manipulate elements to navigate through menus, select game types, and customize their profiles. This is achieved primarily through clickable buttons such as the Login/Register feature and the Add Device/Connect via Bluetooth function. Scrolling is another instance of direct manipulation, allowing users to move seamlessly through different sections of the app. These direct interactions are intuitive and efficient, offering a smooth user experience.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="menu">
      <h3><span>5.2. </span>Menu Based Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        Menus are integral to our app, guiding users through its features and functionalities. Navigation through different pages is done using these menus, which are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Menus serve as the core for the application's functionality and play a crucial role in the user experience.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="command">
      <h3><span>5.3. </span>Command Based Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        Our app incorporates command-based interaction through a text input field on the "Game Options" page. Here, users can input an invite code to join a specific game that others have created. This straightforward command helps the user join a game quickly without having to navigate through numerous menus and options. In addition, our application offers a chat feature in the "Game page". Users can communicate via text or send vocal messages, adding a layer of interaction that enhances the collaborative experience.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="design">
      <h2><span>6. </span>Interaction Design Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        In the design of our application, we employ a variety of interaction design patterns to create a user-friendly interface that both effectively guides users through the app and enhances the overall user experience. Here are three key design patterns utilized:
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="nav-menu">
      <h3><span>6.1. </span>Navigation Menus</h3>
      <p>
        The navigation menus are crucial in our application as they facilitate smooth movement between pages, with straightforward and intuitive names. They are the primary element used by the user to achieve their goals of creating/joining games or connecting to devices. Efficient and easy to use, these menus are complemented by detailed descriptions to assist user comprehension.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="forms">
      <h3><span>6.2. </span>Forms</h3>
      <p>
        Forms are another essential interaction design pattern in our application. Used for login, each form is labeled to guide the user on the required information - username, email, and password. The forms are a mandatory step for users to access the main page and the app's functionalities, such as creating and joining games
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="cards">
      <h3><span>6.3. </span>Cards</h3>
      <p>
        The card design pattern is prevalent across our application. From the main page, which features sections for game options and displays the types of games, to weapons details, "other devices", and "my profile", cards are extensively used. This pattern not only enhances readability but also aids in presenting information in a well-structured, efficient manner. In the "My Profile" page, for instance, cards are used to display user statistics and game history, providing users with easy access to their personal data and performance metrics.
